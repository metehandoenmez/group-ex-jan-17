JS Basic exercise:

let data = [8, 79, 14, 94, 33, 31, 2, 74, 46, 72, 75, 40, 5, 1, 48, 81, 99, 4, 43, 68, 90, 23, 97, 10, 55, 11, 20, 50, 70, 83, 47, 25, 86, 30, 60, 96, 76, 22, 67, 77];

Create a function that sorts the initial number array, from small to big.

Create a function that calculates a total of this array.

Create a function that checks if the total is odd or even.
Return true if it's even, false if it's odd.
Print "Array is odd" or "Array is even" in console, for each case.

Create a function that extracts all odd numbers from this array. Do the same for extracting all the even numbers.

Create a function that calculates the sum of the odd numbers, the even numbers, compares the sums, and returns the array that has the greatest sum.

Optional:

Create a function that receives the array as a parameter, and a callback as another parameter. The callback will be an arrow function that will be applied to each element in the array. so for example (x) => x * 5;
